# Raspberry Pi Pico W Weather Station Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which can read environmental data and display it on an LCD screen. 

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- DHT22 Sensor (for temperature and humidity)
- LCD Display (I2C compatible)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power supply for the Raspberry Pi Pico W

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install the necessary libraries**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed on your Raspberry Pi Pico W for handling the sensors and LCD. You can use the `uasyncio` library for non-blocking operations.
2. **Clone the repository**: Clone this project repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Petas03/ProjektGit.git
   ```
3. **Connect the Hardware**:
   - Connect the DHT22 sensor to the GPIO pins of the Pico.
   - Connect the LCD to the I2C pins (SDA and SCL).
   - Refer to the wiring diagram section below for detailed connections.

## API Configuration
- **API Endpoint**: Set up an API endpoint to send the collected data.
- Use a service like PubNub, MQTT, or a custom backend for data transmission.
- Update the API URL in the source code accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Guide
- **Issue: DHT22 sensor not responding**
  - Check the wiring connections.
  - Ensure the sensor is powered properly.
  - Confirm that the correct GPIO pin is used in the code.

- **Issue: LCD not displaying anything**
  - Double-check the I2C address and wiring.
  - Make sure the display is compatible with the I2C protocol.

## Sample JSON Data
Here is an example of the JSON data that could be generated by the weather station:
```json
{
  "temperature": 23.5,
  "humidity": 60,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-13T12:01:40Z"
}
```

## Conclusion
This README provides all necessary details to set up and run the Raspberry Pi Pico W Weather Station project. Ensure to follow the setup and wiring instructions carefully for smooth operation.
